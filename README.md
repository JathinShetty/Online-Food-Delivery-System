## About the Project
Food Delivery Web Application - Foodiliciousis a one-stop shop for ordering food online and learning about all of the restaurants in the area. We built a platform to give restaurants a place to collaborate and share their menus for various cuisines with their customers. We've also built a platform for customers, allowing them to log in and create their own profile, as well as receive personalised recommendations and take advantage of special offers on the website. Customers can have their own space to share their experiences of the various restaurants they have tried by creating a review section. Our main goal was to make every restaurant a safe haven where all customers and restaurants were in close contact.so that they can directly login and have their own profile and get recommendations accordingly and avail exciting offers on the website. A review section has been created so that the customers can have their own space to share the experiences of the various restaurants that they have tried. Our main goal was to give every restaurant a safe haven where everyone of the customers and restaurants are in a closed knit relation, reducing latency and preventing the usage of several social media means which can easily get confusing, thus ensuring customers never miss any update.
